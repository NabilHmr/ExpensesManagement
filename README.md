# ExpensesManagement
## Goal of this projet

With this project, you will be able to track your expenses. You can add, edit and delete expenses you did. You will have the possibility to watch graphs about your expenses, filter them by year, category and more coming soon.

## Frameworks and libraries used
### Frontend
For the frontend part of this application, we used Vue 3 with Vite. We also used Bootstrap for the styling of the application. 
We used Chart.js for the graphs representation.
### Backend
For the backend part of this application, we used Node.js with Express.
For the storage, we used an ORM called typeORM with a PostgreSQL database.

### Why did we choose these technologies?
- Vue 3 with Vite because it is a modern and fast framework for building web applications. 
- Bootstrap because it is a very popular CSS framework that allows us to build responsive and good-looking websites. 
- Chart.js because it is a simple and flexible JavaScript charting library that allows us to create different types of graphs with the Data we have inside our base. 
- Node.js with Express because it is a fast and minimalist web framework for Node.js. 
- typeORM because it is a powerful ORM that allows us to work with databases in a very easy way. 
- PostgreSQL because it is a powerful, open-source object-relational database system.

For all those choices, there are a lot of documentation and community support that will help us to build this application, that's why we chose them.
